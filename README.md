####Summary:
This C program asks the user for the dimensions of three sides of a triangle. If the side dimensions can make a valid triangle, the program will use those valies to calculate the permiter and the area of the valid triangle. The program exits if it is not a valid triangle.

The program then asks the user for a width and length of a rectangle, calculates the area of the rectangle, and compares it to the area of the valid triangle.

Finally, the program informs the user which of the two areas is greater, or if they are the same.

####Requirements:

- The length of the sides of the triangle must be integers between 1 and 100, inclusive
- The width and length of the rectangle must be float or double
- Use C math functions
- All results must be rounded to one decimal place

####Program input:

- Length of three sides of a triangle
- Width and length of a rectangle

####Program output:

- The perimeter and area of a valid triangle
- The area of the rectangle
- The comparison of both areas
